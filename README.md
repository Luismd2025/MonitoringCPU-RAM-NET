# SRE-Projects
This is a repository in which I will create the SRE academy project. looking to include all the concept an aspects I learned in the SRE academy, important concepts as an example: software engineering principles and system availability.




# Architecture
Flask App: periodically checks a list of URLs defined in urls.yaml, exposes /status and /metrics.
Prometheus: scrapes /metrics every 10 s via a ServiceMonitor.
Grafana: visualizes metrics and latency.
Alertmanager: alerts on failed URL checks; e.g. integration with Slack.
Kubernetes: orchestrates deployment via deployment.yaml, service.yaml, etc.
